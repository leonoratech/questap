# FeaturedTab Enhancement - Course Categories Integration

## Overview
Enhanced the FeaturedTab.tsx component in the QuestEdu React Native app to dynamically populate course categories from the Firebase `courseCategories` collection instead of using hardcoded categories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Category Service (`lib/firebase-category-service.ts`)
- Created a comprehensive Firebase service for course categories
- Provides CRUD operations for category management
- Supports real-time subscriptions for category changes
- Includes proper error handling and logging
- Follows the same pattern as the existing `firebase-course-service.ts`

**Key Methods:**
- `getActiveCategories()` - Fetch only active categories
- `getAllCategories()` - Fetch all categories including inactive
- `getById(id)` - Get category by ID
- `getByName(name)` - Get category by name
- `subscribeToActiveCategories()` - Real-time subscription for active categories
- `getCategoryNames()` - Helper to get category names for display

### 2. Category Service API (`lib/category-service.ts`)
- Created a clean API layer that wraps the Firebase category service
- Provides backward compatibility and simplified method signatures
- Follows the same pattern as `course-service.ts`

### 3. Category Hooks (`hooks/useCategories.ts`)
- Implemented React hooks for category management
- `useActiveCategories()` - Hook for active categories only
- `useAllCategories()` - Hook for all categories
- `useCategories(includeInactive)` - Generic hook with options
- Includes loading states, error handling, and refresh functionality

### 4. Course Type Enhancement (`types/course.ts`)
- Added `categoryId?: string` field to the Course interface
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `category: string` field
- Allows support for both category names and category ID references

### 5. Firebase Course Service Enhancement (`lib/firebase-course-service.ts`)
- Enhanced `documentToCourse()` to handle both `category` and `categoryId` fields
- Added `enrichWithCategoryNames()` method to resolve category IDs to names
- Updated `getAll()` and `subscribeToChanges()` to automatically enrich courses with category names
- Handles Firestore query limitations (10 item limit for 'in' queries) with batching

### 6. FeaturedTab Component Updates (`components/tabs/FeaturedTab.tsx`)
- Replaced hardcoded categories with dynamic Firebase categories
- Added `useActiveCategories` hook for real-time category updates
- Enhanced filtering logic to support both category names and IDs
- Added loading states for both courses and categories
- Improved error handling to show category loading errors
- Updated refresh functionality to refresh both courses and categories

## Data Flow

### Category Retrieval:
```
FeaturedTab → useActiveCategories → category-service → firebase-category-service → Firebase courseCategories collection
```

### Course Enhancement:
```
FeaturedTab → useCourses → course-service → firebase-course-service → enrichWithCategoryNames → Firebase courseCategories collection
```

## Firebase Data Structure

### Course Categories Collection (`courseCategories`)
```javascript
{
  id: 'programming',
  name: 'Programming',
  description: 'Software development, coding, and programming languages',
  subcategories: ['Web Development', 'Mobile Development', ...],
  isActive: true,
  order: 1,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Course Enhancement
Courses with `categoryId` are automatically enriched with the corresponding category `name`:
```javascript
// Before enrichment
{ categoryId: 'programming', category: '' }

// After enrichment  
{ categoryId: 'programming', category: 'Programming' }
```

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Categories**: Categories are now pulled from Firebase and can be managed through the admin interface
2. **Real-time Updates**: Category changes are reflected immediately in the app
3. **Consistent Data Access**: Follows the same Firebase patterns used throughout the app
4. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient category name resolution with batching
5. **Backward Compatible**: Supports both existing category name storage and new categoryId references
6. **Scalable**: Supports future category management features

## Usage

The FeaturedTab now automatically:
- Loads active categories from Firebase
- Displays them as filter chips
- Filters courses by selected category
- Updates in real-time when categories change
- Handles loading and error states gracefully

Categories are managed in the Firebase admin interface and will automatically appear in the mobile app without code changes.
