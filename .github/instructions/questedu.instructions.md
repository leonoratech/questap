## Project in context 
- questedu
- create as a standalone reactnative app 

## Approach
- This project uses reactnative.
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.

## Key Principles
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Only write code that is necessary to complete the task.
- Rewrite the complete code only if necessary.

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
