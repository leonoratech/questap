# QuestEdu Monorepo - Setup Complete! 🎉

Your QuestEdu project has been successfully converted to a pnpm monorepo structure.

## What's New

### 📁 Project Structure
```
questedu/
├── apps/
│   └── questedu/          # Your main app (moved here)
├── packages/
│   └── shared-utils/      # Example shared package
├── package.json           # Root workspace configuration
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml    # pnpm workspace setup
└── Documentation files
```

### ⚡ Quick Commands

All commands run from the root directory:

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                   # Start QuestEdu app
pnpm android              # Run on Android
pnpm ios                  # Run on iOS
pnpm web                  # Run in browser

# Building
pnpm build                # Build QuestEdu app
pnpm build:packages       # Build all shared packages

# Maintenance
pnpm lint                 # Check code quality
pnpm clean                # Clean build artifacts
```

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

- ✅ Converted to pnpm monorepo structure
- ✅ Moved app to `apps/questedu/`
- ✅ Created example shared package
- ✅ Fixed ESLint errors (escaped quotes in DatabaseInitializer)
- ✅ Updated all documentation
- ✅ Tested development server
- ✅ Verified build process

### 📦 Example Shared Package

A sample `@questedu/shared-utils` package has been created with:
- TypeScript utilities (formatDate, capitalize, etc.)
- Proper build configuration
- Documentation

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Start Development**: Run `pnpm dev` to start coding
2. **Share Code**: Move common utilities to `packages/shared-utils`
3. **Add Apps**: Create new apps in `apps/` directory as needed
4. **CI/CD**: Update your deployment pipelines for monorepo structure

### 🚀 Ready to Go!

Your monorepo is fully functional. The QuestEdu app works exactly as before, but now you have:
- Better code organization
- Faster package management with pnpm
- Ability to share code between multiple apps
- Scalable architecture for future growth

Happy coding! 🎯
