# College Authorization Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Users were getting 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing college-specific API endpoints:
- `GET /api/colleges/[id]/programs/[programId]/subjects`
- `GET /api/colleges/[id]/instructors`

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Profile Update Issue (FIXED)
The profile update API route was missing `collegeId` field handling:
- Frontend was sending both `collegeId` and `college` fields
- Backend was only processing the legacy `college` field
- Users' college associations were never being saved to their profiles

### 2. Authorization Logic Issue (FIXED)
College-specific endpoints were using overly restrictive authorization:
- Only checked for `collegeAdministrator` status (formal administrator role)
- Ignored users who had college associations via `collegeId` in their profile
- Different authorization patterns across similar endpoints

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Profile Update API Fix
**File:** `/apps/questadmin/app/api/auth/profile/route.ts`
```typescript
// Added collegeId processing
if (collegeId !== undefined) updates.collegeId = collegeId
```

**File:** `/apps/questadmin/data/config/firebase-auth.ts`
```typescript
// Added type safety for collegeId parameter
collegeId?: string
```

### 2. Authorization Logic Standardization
**Files Updated:**
- `/apps/questadmin/app/api/colleges/[id]/programs/[programId]/subjects/route.ts`
- `/apps/questadmin/app/api/colleges/[id]/instructors/route.ts`

**Authorization Logic Changed From:**
```typescript
// OLD: Only check administrator status
const isAdmin = await isCollegeAdministrator(user.uid, collegeId)
if (!isAdmin && user.role !== 'superadmin') {
  return 403
}
```

**Authorization Logic Changed To:**
```typescript
// NEW: Check both college association AND administrator status
if (user.role === 'superadmin') {
  // Superadmins can access any college
} else if (user.role === 'instructor') {
  const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(serverDb, 'users', user.uid))
  const userData = userDoc.exists() ? userDoc.data() : null
  
  const userCollegeId = userData?.collegeId
  const isOwnCollege = userCollegeId === collegeId
  const isCollegeAdmin = await isCollegeAdministrator(user.uid, collegeId)
  
  if (!isOwnCollege && !isCollegeAdmin) {
    return 403
  }
} else {
  return 403
}
```

## Authorization Patterns Now Consistent

The updated endpoints now use the same authorization pattern as other working endpoints:

### Access Levels:
1. **Superadmins:** Can access any college
2. **Instructors:** Can access:
   - Their own college (if `collegeId` in profile matches)
   - Colleges they formally administer (if entry exists in `collegeAdministrators` collection)
3. **Students/Others:** No access to these administrative endpoints

### Benefits:
- ✅ Users can properly update their college associations
- ✅ College association through profile `collegeId` is now recognized
- ✅ Formal college administrators maintain their access
- ✅ Consistent authorization logic across all college endpoints
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. **Profile Update Test:**
   - User updates profile with college selection
   - Verify `collegeId` is saved to user document in Firestore

2. **Endpoint Access Test:**
   - User with `collegeId` in profile can access college-specific endpoints
   - Formal college administrators maintain their access
   - Users without college association are properly denied

## Files Modified
- `/apps/questadmin/app/api/auth/profile/route.ts` - Profile update API
- `/apps/questadmin/data/config/firebase-auth.ts` - Type definitions
- `/apps/questadmin/app/api/colleges/[id]/programs/[programId]/subjects/route.ts` - Subjects endpoint
- `/apps/questadmin/app/api/colleges/[id]/instructors/route.ts` - Instructors endpoint

The fix ensures that college associations work properly while maintaining security and backward compatibility.
