  // Includes proper error handling
}
```

#### 4. `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
**Updated UserProfile interface:**
```typescript
export interface UserProfile {
  // ...existing fields...
  collegeId?: string;   // New: Reference to college document

  college?: string;     // Kept for backward compatibility
}
```

#### 5. `/lib/user-profile-service.ts`
