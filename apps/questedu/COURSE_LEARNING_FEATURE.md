### Key Services

1. **Course Learning Service** (`lib/course-learning-service.ts`)
   - Fetches course topics and questions
   - Manages learning sessions
   - Tracks progress and completion
   - Handles Firebase operations

2. **Learning Components** (`components/learning/`)
   - **LearningSlideViewer**: Main container with navigation
   - **TopicSlide**: Displays topic content and materials
   - **QuestionSlide**: Handles questions and answer submission

## Usage

### Starting a Course

1. Navigate to course details page
2. Ensure you're enrolled in the course
3. Click "Continue Learning" or "Start Learning"
4. The learning interface will load with slides

### Navigation

- **Next/Previous Buttons**: Navigate between slides
- **Progress Bar**: Shows overall completion
- **Completion Tracking**: Automatically saves progress

### Question Types Supported

1. **Multiple Choice**: Select one answer from options
2. **True/False**: Simple boolean questions
3. **Fill in the Blank**: Text input for answers
4. **Essay Questions**: Multi-line text responses

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Collections

The feature relies on these Firestore collections:

1. **courses**: Basic course information
2. **courseTopics**: Topic content and metadata
3. **courseQuestions**: Questions linked to topics
4. **learningSessions**: User progress tracking
5. **enrollments**: Enrollment and completion data

### TypeScript Interfaces

Key interfaces defined in `types/learning.ts`:

- `CourseTopic`: Topic content structure
- `CourseQuestion`: Question and answer format
- `LearningSlide`: Unified slide interface
- `LearningSession`: Progress tracking
- `LearningData`: Complete learning context

### State Management

- **Local State**: Current slide index, UI interactions
- **Session State**: Progress, completed slides, user answers
- **Persistent State**: Firebase-synced learning sessions

## Mobile Optimizations

1. **Touch Interface**: Large touch targets, easy navigation
2. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
3. **Performance**: Optimized Firebase queries and local caching
4. **Offline Support**: Local state preservation (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Swipe Navigation**: Gesture-based slide navigation
2. **Rich Media**: Video and audio content support
3. **Offline Mode**: Download content for offline learning
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed learning analytics
5. **Gamification**: Points, badges, and achievements
6. **Social Features**: Discussion threads and peer interaction

### Technical Improvements

1. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large courses
2. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
