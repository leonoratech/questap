# FeaturedTab College-Specific Filtering Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the FeaturedTab in the questedu React Native app to show only courses associated with the student's college and added advanced filtering capabilities for college programs, semesters, and subjects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. College-Specific Course Filtering

- **Base Filtering**: Courses are now filtered by the user's `collegeId` from their profile
- **Association Support**: Courses with `association` objects containing college/program/subject relationships are properly handled
- **Fallback Behavior**: Users without college associations see all courses with a warning message

### 2. Enhanced Course Data Model

- **Course Association Interface**: Added `CourseAssociation` interface to support college, program, and subject relationships
- **Course Type Updates**: Updated `Course` interface to include optional `association` field
- **Firebase Integration**: Enhanced Firebase course service to handle association-based queries

### 3. Advanced Filter UI Components

- **CourseFilters Modal**: Created a comprehensive filter modal with cascading dropdowns
- **Program Selection**: Users can filter courses by their college's programs
- **Year/Semester Selection**: Filter by specific years or semesters within programs
- **Subject Selection**: Filter by specific subjects within year/semester combinations
- **Active Filter Display**: Shows applied filters as removable chips

### 4. New Service Layer

- **College Data Service**: Created service to fetch college, program, and subject data
- **Enhanced Course Service**: Added methods for college-specific and association-based course filtering
- **Firebase Course Service**: Extended with new query methods for association filtering

### 5. New React Hooks

- **useCollegeCourses Hook**: Custom hook for college-specific course management with filtering support
- **Filter State Management**: Handles filter state and real-time course updates based on filters

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes

#### New Files Created
- `/components/CourseFilters.tsx` - Filter UI component with cascading dropdowns
- `/hooks/useCollegeCourses.ts` - College-specific course management hook
- `/lib/college-data-service.ts` - Service for college/program/subject data (previously created)

#### Modified Files
- `/components/tabs/FeaturedTab.tsx` - Enhanced with college filtering and filter UI
- `/types/course.ts` - Added CourseAssociation interface and association field
- `/lib/firebase-course-service.ts` - Added college-specific query methods
- `/lib/course-service.ts` - Added college filtering functions
- `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Exported AuthContext for component access

### Key Features

#### 1. College Association Detection
```typescript
const { userProfile } = useAuth();
const hasCollegeAssociation = !!userProfile?.collegeId;
```

#### 2. Association-Based Course Queries
```typescript
// Filter courses by college
const q = query(
  coursesRef,
  where('association.collegeId', '==', collegeId),
  orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
);

// Filter with multiple criteria
const q = query(
  coursesRef,
  where('association.collegeId', '==', filters.collegeId),
  where('association.programId', '==', filters.programId),
  where('association.yearOrSemester', '==', filters.yearOrSemester)
);
```

#### 3. Cascading Filter Logic
```typescript
// Program selection loads years/semesters
const handleProgramSelect = (program: Program) => {
  setSelectedProgram(program);
  loadYearOptions(program);
};

// Year selection loads subjects
const handleYearSelect = (year: number) => {
  setSelectedYear(year);
  if (selectedProgram) {
    loadSubjects(selectedProgram.id, year);
  }
};
```

#### 4. Real-Time Course Subscription
```typescript
// Subscribe to college-specific courses
const unsubscribe = subscribeToCollegeCourses(collegeId, (courses) => {
  setCourses(courses);
  setLoading(false);
});
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Students without college associations see all courses with an informational message
- Students with college associations see only relevant courses by default
- Advanced filters are available for further refinement

### 2. Visual Filter Feedback
- Filter button shows count of active filters
- Applied filters are displayed as removable chips
- Clear visual distinction between filtered and unfiltered views

### 3. Responsive Filter Interface
- Modal-based filter interface for comprehensive filtering options
- Intuitive cascading dropdowns (College → Program → Year → Subject)
- Real-time filter application with immediate results

### 4. Error Handling and Loading States
- Proper loading states during course fetching
- Error handling for network issues
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Database Requirements

### Firestore Indexes Required
The following Firestore composite indexes are needed for optimal performance:

```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "courses",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "association.collegeId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
},
{
  "collectionGroup": "courses",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION", 
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "association.programId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
},
{
  "collectionGroup": "courses",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "association.programId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "association.yearOrSemester", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic College Filtering
```typescript
// Automatically filter by user's college
const { courses, loading, error } = useCollegeCourses();
```

### Advanced Filtering
```typescript
// Filter by specific criteria
const filters = {
  programId: 'mit-cs-bs',
  yearOrSemester: 2,
  subjectId: 'algorithms-101'
};
const { courses } = useCollegeCourses(filters);
```

### Filter UI Integration
```tsx
<CourseFilters
  visible={showFilterModal}
  onDismiss={() => setShowFilterModal(false)}
  onApplyFilters={handleApplyFilters}
  currentFilters={courseFilters}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Relevance**: Students see only courses relevant to their academic program
2. **Better Organization**: Courses are organized by academic structure (college/program/subject)
3. **Enhanced Discovery**: Advanced filtering helps students find specific courses
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports multiple colleges and programs
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries reduce data transfer and improve loading times
6. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with progressive disclosure of filtering options

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest courses based on program requirements
2. **Progress Tracking**: Show program completion progress
3. **Prerequisites Checking**: Validate course prerequisites automatically
4. **Academic Calendar Integration**: Filter by semester/term availability
5. **Multi-Program Support**: Support students enrolled in multiple programs
6. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search within filtered course sets

## Testing Considerations

1. **College Association States**: Test with and without college associations
2. **Filter Combinations**: Test various filter combinations
3. **Data Loading**: Test with different data loading states
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures and data inconsistencies
5. **Performance**: Test with large course datasets
6. **Offline Behavior**: Test filter functionality in offline scenarios

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Firestore indexes are deployed before releasing
2. Test with real college/program/subject data
3. Verify filter performance with production data volumes
4. Monitor query performance and optimize as needed
5. Consider implementing query caching for frequently accessed data
