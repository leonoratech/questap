# Course Image Upload Feature Refactoring - Complete

## Overview
Successfully refactored the course image upload feature to use server-side API calls with JWT authentication and Firebase Admin SDK, removing all client-side Firebase dependencies as requested.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Client-Side Firebase)
```
UI Component → Firebase Storage Client SDK → Firebase Storage
```

### After (Server-Side API)
```
UI Component → HTTP Service → API Route → Firebase Admin SDK → Firebase Storage
```

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Server-Side API Routes

#### `/app/api/courses/images/route.ts` (NEW)
- **POST**: Upload course images with authentication and validation
- **DELETE**: Delete course images with proper authorization
- Features:
  - JWT token verification
  - File validation (type, size, format)
  - User permission checks (instructor or superadmin)
  - Image processing with Sharp (resize, compress)
  - Thumbnail generation
  - Firebase Storage upload using Admin SDK
  - Public URL generation

#### `/app/api/courses/images/proxy/route.ts` (NEW)
- **GET**: Secure image serving through server proxy
- Features:
  - Optional authentication for private images
  - Cache headers for performance
  - Error handling for missing files

### 2. Client-Side Service

#### `/data/services/image-upload-service.ts` (REFACTORED)
- Completely refactored to use HTTP API calls instead of Firebase client SDK
- Functions:
  - `uploadCourseImage()`: Standard upload via API
  - `uploadCourseImageWithProgress()`: Upload with progress tracking using XMLHttpRequest
  - `deleteCourseImage()`: Delete via API with authentication
  - `validateImageFile()`: Client-side validation
- Features:
  - JWT authentication headers
  - Form data preparation
  - Progress tracking support
  - Error handling

### 3. UI Components

#### `/components/CourseImageUpload.tsx` (UPDATED)
- Added `currentImageStoragePath` prop for proper deletion
- Updated image removal to use API-based deletion
- Enhanced error handling
- Maintains same UI/UX but uses new API service

### 4. Form Components

#### `/app/courses/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- Added `currentImageStoragePath` prop to CourseImageUpload
- Image state management includes storage path

#### `/app/courses/new/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- Added `currentImageStoragePath` prop to CourseImageUpload
- Form data includes image storage path

## Security Improvements

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- All image operations now require valid JWT tokens
- User permission checks (instructor can only modify own courses)
- Superadmin can modify any course images

### 2. Validation
- Server-side file type validation
- File size limits (5MB)
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Course ownership verification

### 3. Secure Storage
- Images stored in structured Firebase Storage paths
- Public URLs generated server-side
- Optional secure serving through proxy API

## Technical Features

### 1. Image Processing
- Server-side image processing with Sharp library
- Automatic resizing (max 1200x800px)
- JPEG compression with configurable quality
- Thumbnail generation (300x200px)

### 2. Performance
- Progress tracking for uploads
- Efficient buffer handling
- Cache headers for served images
- Optimized image formats

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Client and server-side validation
- Graceful fallbacks

## Dependencies

### Added
- `sharp`: Server-side image processing
- `firebase-admin/storage`: Server-side Firebase Storage

### Removed
- All client-side Firebase Storage imports:
  - `firebase/storage`
  - `getDownloadURL`, `ref`, `uploadBytes`, etc.

## API Endpoints

### Image Upload
```
POST /api/courses/images
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

Body:
- file: File
- courseId: string
- instructorId: string
- quality: number (optional)
- maxWidth: number (optional)
- maxHeight: number (optional)
```

### Image Deletion
```
DELETE /api/courses/images?storagePath=<path>&courseId=<id>
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

### Image Proxy (Optional)
```
GET /api/courses/images/proxy?path=<storage-path>&courseId=<id>
```

## Testing

### Validation Script
Created `test-image-upload-refactor.js` to validate:
- API endpoints exist and respond correctly
- Authentication requirements work
- Error handling functions properly

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Course creation with image upload
- [ ] Course editing with image replacement
- [ ] Image deletion functionality
- [ ] Progress tracking during upload
- [ ] Error handling for invalid files
- [ ] Permission checks for different user roles

## Database Schema

Course documents now properly include image fields:
```json
{
  "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/...",
  "imageFileName": "course_12345_timestamp.jpg",
  "imageStoragePath": "courses/instructorId/courseId/images/filename.jpg",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/..."
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Security**: All operations require authentication and authorization
2. **Architecture Compliance**: Follows UI → Service → API → Repository pattern
3. **Performance**: Server-side image processing and optimization
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized image handling logic
5. **Scalability**: API-based approach supports future enhancements
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image CDN**: Consider using Firebase CDN or CloudFlare for image delivery
2. **Advanced Processing**: Add watermarking, format conversion, etc.
3. **Batch Operations**: Support multiple image uploads
4. **Image Variants**: Generate multiple sizes automatically
5. **Analytics**: Track image upload/view metrics

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Firebase Admin SDK is properly configured in production
2. Set appropriate Firebase Storage CORS rules
3. Configure environment variables for service account
4. Test image upload limits and Firebase Storage quotas
5. Monitor Sharp library performance in serverless environments
