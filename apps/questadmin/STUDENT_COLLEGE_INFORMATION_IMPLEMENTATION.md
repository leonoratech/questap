# Student College Information Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation extends the existing college information feature to allow students to view their associated college information and statistics, similar to instructors.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Navigation Enhancement
- **Updated Sidebar Component**: Added "College" menu item for students in addition to instructors
- **Role-based Display**: The College menu now appears for both 'instructor' and 'student' roles
- **Consistent UI**: Students get the same navigation experience as instructors

### 2. API Access Control Updates
- **Updated College API**: Modified `/api/colleges/[id]/route.ts` to allow students to view their own college
- **Updated Stats API**: Modified `/api/colleges/[id]/stats/route.ts` to allow students to view their college stats
- **Security**: Students can only access information for their own associated college (based on `collegeId` in their profile)

### 3. College Information Page Updates
- **Shared Page**: Extended existing `/college` page to work for both instructors and students
- **Role-based Features**: 
  - Students see: College basic information, statistics, contact info, address
  - Instructors see: All of the above + Program Management (if they are college administrators)
- **AuthGuard**: Updated to allow both `UserRole.INSTRUCTOR` and `UserRole.STUDENT`

### 4. Conditional Program Management
- **Administrator Check**: Only instructors who are college administrators can see the Program Management section
- **Student Experience**: Students see a clean, informational view without administrative tools

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. Sidebar Component (`components/Sidebar.tsx`)
```typescript
// Updated navigation item to include students
{
  title: 'College',
  href: '/college',
  icon: GraduationCap,
  roles: ['instructor', 'student']  // Added 'student'
}
```

#### 2. College API (`app/api/colleges/[id]/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Added student access control
} else if (user.role === UserRole.STUDENT) {
  // Students can view their own college (if collegeId matches their profile)
  const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(serverDb, 'users', user.uid))
  const userData = userDoc.exists() ? userDoc.data() : null
  
  const userCollegeId = userData?.collegeId
  const isOwnCollege = userCollegeId === collegeId
  
  if (!isOwnCollege) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Access denied. You can only view your own college information.' },
      { status: 403 }
    )
  }
}
```

#### 3. College Stats API (`app/api/colleges/[id]/stats/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Added similar student access control and permission checks
```

#### 4. College Information Page (`app/college/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Updated AuthGuard to allow both roles
<AuthGuard requiredRoles={[UserRole.INSTRUCTOR, UserRole.STUDENT]}>

// Conditional Program Management
{userProfile?.role === UserRole.INSTRUCTOR && isAdministrator && (
  <div className="mt-8">
    <ProgramManager 
      collegeId={college.id!}
      collegeName={college.name}
      isAdministrator={isAdministrator}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

## User Experience

### For Students:
1. **New Menu Item**: "College" appears in sidebar navigation
2. **Automatic Routing**: Clicking takes them to their associated college page
3. **Rich Information**: View college details and community statistics
4. **Profile Integration**: Uses existing collegeId from student profile
5. **Clean Interface**: No administrative tools, focused on information consumption

### For Instructors:
1. **Unchanged Experience**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Administrative Tools**: Program management still available for college administrators
3. **Same Navigation**: College menu item works as before

### Information Displayed for Students:
1. **College Basic Information**:
   - Name, Principal, Status
   - Accreditation and Affiliation
   - Description

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Number of Students
   - Number of Instructors
   - Total Staff Count
   - Total Users

3. **Contact Information**:
   - Phone, Email, Website
   - Physical Address

## Security & Access Control
- **Role-based Access**: Both instructors and students can access `/college` route
- **AuthGuard Protection**: Page requires INSTRUCTOR or STUDENT role
- **Profile-based Association**: Uses authenticated user's collegeId
- **Ownership Validation**: Students can only view their own college information
- **API Security**: Server-side validation ensures students cannot access other colleges' data

## Error Scenarios Handled
1. **No College Association**: Clear message with link to update profile
2. **College Not Found**: Helpful error with retry option
3. **API Failures**: Graceful error handling with toast notifications
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
5. **Access Denied**: Clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts

## Integration with Existing System
- **Leverages Existing**: Uses current college service and data models
- **Profile Integration**: Works with existing student profile structure
- **UI Consistency**: Follows existing design patterns and components
- **Role System**: Integrates with current role-based navigation
- **Backwards Compatible**: No breaking changes to instructor functionality

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Login as a student with a collegeId in their profile (e.g., alice.wilson@student.com)
2. Navigate to the "College" menu item in the sidebar
3. Verify college information and statistics display correctly
4. Confirm Program Management section is not visible for students
5. Test error scenarios (student without college association)
6. Verify instructors still have full access including Program Management

## Student Data Association
Students in the seed data already have college associations:
- Alice Wilson (`alice.wilson@student.com`) - MIT
- Bob Davis (`bob.davis@student.com`) - Stanford
- Carol Martinez (`carol.martinez@student.com`) - IIT Bombay
- David Lee (`david.lee@student.com`) - University of Cambridge
- Eva Garcia (`eva.garcia@student.com`) - Community College
- Frank Taylor (`frank.taylor@student.com`) - Community College

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements that could be added:
- Student-specific college announcements
- Campus event listings for students
- College-specific course recommendations
- Student organizations and clubs information
- Campus facilities and resources directory
- Academic calendar integration
