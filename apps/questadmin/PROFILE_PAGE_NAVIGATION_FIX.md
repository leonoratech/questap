# Profile Page Navigation Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** Profile page navigation was failing with error "Error: The default export is not a React Component in '/profile/page'"

**Root Cause:** The main profile page file (`/app/profile/page.tsx`) was empty, causing Next.js to throw an error when trying to render the component.

## Solution Applied
1. **Identified the Issue:** Found that the profile page file was empty while an enhanced version existed in `page-enhanced.tsx`
2. **Transferred Content:** Copied the complete enhanced profile page implementation to the main `page.tsx` file
3. **Cleanup:** Removed the temporary enhanced file after successful transfer
4. **Verification:** Confirmed no compilation errors exist in the updated profile page

## Files Modified
- `/apps/questadmin/app/profile/page.tsx` - Populated with complete profile page implementation
- `/apps/questadmin/app/profile/page-enhanced.tsx` - Removed (temporary file)

## Profile Page Features
The restored profile page includes:
- **Profile Picture Management** - Avatar display with initials fallback
- **Role-based Form Sections** - Dynamic fields based on user role (Instructor/Student)
- **Comprehensive Profile Editing** - All user profile fields including role-specific ones
- **Account Status Display** - Shows role, member since, profile completion, and account status
- **Success/Error Messaging** - User feedback for profile updates
- **Admin Controls** - Role management for administrators
