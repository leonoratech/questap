# FeaturedTab ProgramId Filter Bug Fix

## Issue Description
**Problem**: Logged-in users with valid `collegeId` and `programId` in their profiles were not seeing courses filtered by their program in the FeaturedTab, despite having courses associated with their program in the database.

**Symptoms**:
- User has `collegeId` and `programId` in profile
- Courses exist that should match the user's program
- FeaturedTab shows "No courses found" when filtering by programId
- Filtering appears to work (shows filter chips) but returns no results

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Inflexible Database Query Strategy
The `getCoursesWithFilters` function in `/apps/questedu/lib/firebase-course-service.ts` was only querying for courses using a specific nested structure (`association.programId`), but courses in the database might have different data structures:

1. **Nested association structure**: `{ association: { collegeId, programId, yearOrSemester, subjectId } }`
2. **Direct field structure**: `{ collegeId, programId, yearOrSemester, subjectId }`
3. **Mixed or legacy structures**: Various combinations of the above

### Secondary Issue: Missing Auto-filtering
The `useCollegeCourses` hook was not automatically applying the user's `programId` as a filter when they had one in their profile, requiring manual filter selection every time.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Query Strategy (`firebase-course-service.ts`)

Implemented a **3-tier fallback strategy** for flexible course querying:

```typescript
// Strategy 1: Try association-based query first
let courses = await this.tryAssociationQuery(coursesRef, filters);

if (courses.length === 0 && filters.collegeId) {
  // Strategy 2: Try direct collegeId field query
  courses = await this.tryDirectCollegeQuery(coursesRef, filters);
  
  if (courses.length === 0) {
    // Strategy 3: Get all courses and filter in memory
    courses = await this.tryInMemoryFiltering(coursesRef, filters);
  }
}
```

**Strategy 1 - Association Query**: 
- Queries `association.collegeId`, `association.programId`, etc.
- For courses with nested association objects

**Strategy 2 - Direct Field Query**:
- Queries direct `collegeId` field, then filters programId in memory
- Handles courses with direct field structure

**Strategy 3 - In-Memory Filtering**:
- Gets all courses (limited to 100 for performance)
- Filters in JavaScript to handle any data structure
- Last resort for complex or mixed data structures

### 2. Auto-filtering Enhancement (`useCollegeCourses.ts`)

Enhanced the hook to **automatically apply user's programId** when available:

```typescript
// Auto-apply user's programId if they have one and no explicit programId filter is provided
const effectiveFilters = { ...filters };
if (userProfile.programId && !effectiveFilters.programId) {
  effectiveFilters.programId = userProfile.programId;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Users automatically see courses relevant to their program
- No manual filter selection required
- Explicit filters still override auto-filtering
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. Comprehensive Debugging (`course-diagnostics.ts`)

Added diagnostic tools to analyze course data structures:

```typescript
// Analyze what data structures exist in the database
await analyzeCourseDataStructure();

// Test filtering with specific criteria
await testCourseFiltering({ collegeId, programId });

// Debug for specific user profile
await debugUserCourseFiltering(userProfile);
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging throughout the query process:

- Query strategy selection
- Individual strategy results
- Data structure analysis
- Filter application details
- Performance metrics

## Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `/apps/questedu/lib/firebase-course-service.ts` - Enhanced query strategy
- `/apps/questedu/hooks/useCollegeCourses.ts` - Auto-filtering logic

### Diagnostics & Debugging  
- `/apps/questedu/lib/course-diagnostics.ts` - New diagnostic tools
- `/apps/questedu/components/tabs/FeaturedTab.tsx` - Added debugging hooks

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **User with programId**: Verify auto-filtering works
2. **User without programId**: Verify fallback to college courses
3. **Manual filters**: Verify explicit filters override auto-filtering
4. **Mixed data structures**: Test with various course data formats

### Diagnostic Testing
```typescript
// In browser console or during development
import { debugUserCourseFiltering } from '../lib/course-diagnostics';
await debugUserCourseFiltering(userProfile);
```

## Backwards Compatibility

âœ… **Maintains full backwards compatibility**:
- Existing course data structures continue to work
- No migration required
- Graceful degradation for edge cases
- Fallback to general courses when no matches found

## Performance Considerations

- **Strategy 1 & 2**: Use native Firestore queries (optimal performance)
- **Strategy 3**: Limited to 100 courses to prevent excessive data transfer
- **Caching**: Results cached by React hooks as before
- **Logging**: Only enabled in development mode

## Error Handling

- Each strategy wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Graceful fallback between strategies
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Never breaks user experience - always returns empty array on failure

## Expected Outcomes

### âœ… Immediate Fixes
1. Users with programId automatically see relevant courses
2. Different course data structures all supported
3. No "No courses found" errors for valid user profiles
4. Smooth user experience without manual filtering

### âœ… Long-term Benefits
1. Robust handling of any course data structure
2. Comprehensive debugging tools for future issues
3. Flexible foundation for additional filters
4. Better insights into data quality and structure

## Usage Example

```typescript
// User logs in with profile: { collegeId: "college123", programId: "program456" }
// FeaturedTab automatically applies programId filter
// Shows courses matching both college and program
// User can still apply additional filters manually
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor logs** in development to see which strategy is being used
2. **Run diagnostics** to understand current data structures
3. **Consider data migration** if Strategy 3 is used frequently
4. **Add performance metrics** for query optimization

---

This fix ensures that users see relevant courses immediately upon login, while maintaining flexibility for different course data structures and providing tools for ongoing maintenance and debugging.
